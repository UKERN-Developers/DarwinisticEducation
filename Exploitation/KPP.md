# Bypassing Kernel Patch Protection
Bypassing kernel patch protection in iOS

## About
Starting from iOS 9 all 64-bit ARM devices have kernel patch protection implemented.
 which in basic means that something other than the kernel checks every now and then for kernel integrity and when integrity checks fail panics causing a total reboot.

## Integrity Checks
KPP only checks _TEXT and _DATA.__const, it is speculated that the Secure Enclave Processor or the Secure Monitor are performing these checks.

## Bypass
Current bypasses actually avoid KPP entirely and were firstly demonstrated in Pangu9, the jailbreak for iOS 9 by the notorious jailbreak team of Chinese security researchers named Pangu.
In Pangu9, pangu replaced hooks in Apple Mobile File Integrity's to either disable or alter the checks.
This technique has been mitigated in iOS 9.2 by moving MAC policies into __const.

## Jailbreaks without dealing with KPP
It is however still possible to remount the rootfs by without dealing with KPP by unprotecting the rootpartion in the structure instead of patching the actual check.
