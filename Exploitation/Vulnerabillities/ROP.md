# ROP
### What is ROP?
ROP is an acronym for Return Oriented Programming.
Return Oriented Programming is a method for gaining arbitrary code execution after the discovery of a memory corruption vulnerability. It revolves around using code that already exists in the program to do things that the program was never intended to do.

### Using ROP
When using ROP for exploitation the first step is collecting ROP gadgets, small instructions that exist in the program and can be used to perform the logic you want.

For this, basic understanding about what a ROP gadget is and how to find them is needed.
This process will require some reverse engineering. Below is demonstrated how a ROP gadget could look like on ARM.

*example gadget:*

```S
LDMFD   SP1, {R0, R1, PC}
```

This is a simple gadget, all it does is puts the values that are on the top of the stack into Register 0, Register 1, and the Process Counter giving you the ability to use it to point to anywhere else in the program by using a stack overflow in combination with other ROP gadgets.
