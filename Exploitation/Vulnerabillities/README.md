## Scope and Risk Analysis
Before a penetration test or security research is done a document is made defining the scope.

A scope could be to find a vulnerability in the kernel for gainging kernel memory read and write access.

For this scope there could be an example template as following:
- Target: Kernel
- Impact: Access to restricted kernel memory
- Severity: Medium
- Scope element: Mach traps and exception handling

From this example it is clear that the attack goes out to finding bugs in the exception handling and traps of the MACH kernel component.

The scope does not cover many internals about how the researcher will work his way to the impact.

After the research a document is made describing what results came out of it with conclusions.

Each finding is given a severity ranging from 0 - 100 and advisory is provided about how to mitigate the issue.
