# Heap Overflow

A heap overflow is a type of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap memory of a program.

Heap overflows are exploitable in a different manner to that of stack-based overflows.

Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at runtime and typically contains program data.

Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in a specific way to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers.

The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as malloc meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer.

This way an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution
