# Double Free
A double free vulnerability is a vulnerability caused due to a pointer to memory being freed twice.

Double free vulnerabilities alone are often not useful in exploits other than to serve as a Denial of Service attack (crash).

This is due to the lack of control over memory with this vulnerability.

The memory can be altered using a Double Free vulnerability but no control can be gained over how it is altered.

In XNU (iOS / macOS kernel) a panic log mentioning that a freed zone element has been modified may mean that a double free had occured in a kernel zone.

The main reason why a programmer would make the mistake of freeing an object twice is because the programmer may not take account this possibility while developing his logic flow.

*doublefree.c:*
```C

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

        char* ptr = malloc(sizeof(char) * 3); //size just big enough to store my name

        *ptr = 'sem';
        free(ptr); //first free (normal)
        free(ptr); //second free (bad)
        return 0;
}

 ```
