# Responsible Disclosure
Did you know you are legally allowed to find vulnerabilities in commonly used software and websites if you follow simple rules?

## About
Responsible Disclosure is a policy for ethically finding and reporting vulnerabilities to vendors whenever you find them.

In some countries the policy of responsible disclosure has become part of the law (Like in the Netherlands), meaning that if you follow these rules you cannot be prosecuted for an attempt of computer abuse / information breach / counter terrorism.

Responsible Disclosure basically means that whenever you find a vulnerability, you do not exploit it but do provide a small proof of concept to show that the vulnerability is there.

The vulnerability must not be shared with anyone other than the vendor of the software, system or hardware you found it in.

You should respect the vendor's wishes when reporting meaning that if the vendor does not want you to publish about it you should not.

Most vendors have a 90-day disclosure policy which means that you are allowed to publish about the vulnerability 90 days after you reported it.

## Bug Bounty
Some vendors or organizations such as HackerOne and ZeroCopter give bug bounty when you report a vulnerability doing responsible disclosure.

It is important to take in account what third party you are sharing it with, ZeroCopter and HackerOne are respectable organizations that aggociate with the vendor about the vulnerability.

Companies like Zerodium are not respectable as they keep their vulnerabilities to themselves thus reporting to them would not be ethical and might even be illegal.

Depending on the impact of the vulnerability companies who provide bug bounty will pay out an amount of money or give you a small reward.

Examples are for example $1,000 for a stored XSS in a big warehouse company or A T-Shirt from the government mentioning "I hacked the government and all I got is this loosy T-Shirt".

Despite the nice bounty that you sometimes can receive it is more valuable to be able to publish about your findings as that will be useful when applying to a position.

## CVE's
A CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposure) is an advisory that may be given to a reported vulnerability when it affects a lot of users or systems.

CVE's are bought by companies each year and in the CVE the reporter of the vulnerability is credited.

An example is for example the bug in Notifications of iOS 10.3.2 I reported a few years back which got a CVE, CVE-2017-6982.

Apple barely accredits CVE's for such small highlevel vulnerabilities but due to the explanation on how it could be used in malware I and the people I found it with were accredited a CVE.

If you want to get a lot of CVE's on your name it is the best to just buy a couple of IoT devices and do some reverse engineering and analysis on the firmware.

Many times buffer overflows, xss or other vulnerabilities exist in these poorly secured devices due to them being old but still used.
