# Null Dereference

## About
Null dereferences are vulnerabilities where a null pointer is being freed or a null pointer being used to copy or read data from.

This type of vulnerability will terminate the process because the processor will try to access memory at address 0x0 (NULL), which obviously will not exist in the address space.

An exploit for a null derefence therefore can better be called a Denial of Service.

Null dereferences are a sign of poorly written logic and programmers should really be ashamed when they leave vulnerabilities like these in their programs.

An example of a null dereference vulnerability could look like this

```C
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>


	//function for printing out an array of numbers
	void printnum(int* nums, int len) {
	        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
	                printf("Number: %d\n",nums[i]);
	        }
	}

	int main(int argc, char **argv) {

	        //create an array with enough memory for 10 numbers
	        int* number = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);

	        //put some random numbers in the array
	        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	                number[i] = random() % (10 +1);
	        }

	        printnum(number, 10);

	        number = NULL; //lets say we don't need this anymore forgetting that we still use the number elsewhere

	        printnum(number, 10); //null dereferce, as the array is null now.

	        free(number);
	        return 0;
	}
```
